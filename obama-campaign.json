And over the last four years, every time we’ve tried to make a change, they’ve fought back with everything they’ve got. They spent millions to stop us from reforming health care and Wall Street and student loans. And their strategy from the start was to engineer pure gridlock in Congress, refusing to compromise on ideas that both Democrats and Republicans had supported in the past."

This is a choice not just between two candidates or two parties. It’s a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. It’s a choice between going back to the top-down policies that crashed our economy, or adapting the kinds of policies that will make sure we’ve got a strong and growing middle class. That’s the choice."
